# Open3D implementation of the paper Estimating Discrete Total Curvature with Per Triangle Normal Variation

A universal total curvature estimation method that works for both triangle meshes and point clouds. For details, see the 2023 SIGGRAPH paper by Crane Chen under the supervision of Misha Kazhdan.

## Dependencies

The code was developed on MacOS 12.6, adapting from the template code of open3d, [open3d-cmake-find-package](https://github.com/isl-org/open3d-cmake-find-package.git)

- [open3d](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git)
- [STL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/)
- [eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for matrix data structures
- [openmp](http://polyscope.run/) for parallelization
- [cgal](https://www.cgal.org/) for delaunay triangulation


## Run

From within the `build` directory, for triangle mesh, just issue:

    ./Draw

**Compile**

Fetch the code with dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/HeCraneChen/open3d-discrete-total-curvature.git --recursive

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    cd total-curvature-estimation
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

The above commands use FetchContent of CMake to automatically download libigl and its dependencies. If that did not work for you, try to point to the local libigl. In that case, use

    cmake -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LIBIGL=../libigl ..
to replace

    cmake ..
